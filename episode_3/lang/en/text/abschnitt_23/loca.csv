sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#0;[A dune. The young woman is sitting on a picnic blanket and watch the sea.]
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#1;[The young woman looks to the sea (idle).]
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#2;[Cut to closeup.]
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#3;[Feets are coming into the picture. She looks up.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_1;Hello there, handsome devil.
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#5;[The Arab sits next to her in the wind, gives her a kiss.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_2;Hey there, pretty lady.
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#7;[The Arab continues to kiss, but she pulls away.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_3;Don't. My father will be here any moment.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_4;Did you tell him about our engagement?
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_5_direction;from the off
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_5;She did.
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#11;[Cut to Ohi, who is standing behind them.]
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#12;[Ohi is behind the two, both are turning around while sitting.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_6_direction;slightly reproachful
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_6;I almost slipped out of character.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_7;Oh, Daddy... We all know that'd never happen. You were Anton Jakob Zellner through and through - even with the world crashing down around you.
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#15;[As she talks, the young woman stretched out his hand inviting Ohi. He takes the hand, and sits down with the two.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_8_direction;satisfied
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_8;Didn't go too badly, did it?
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_9;Well, Inch nearly blew us up and I was almost charged with murder.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_10_direction;happy
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_10;Ah, yes-exciting, wasn't it?
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_11;I haven't had fun like that since I retired.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_12_direction;serious, somewhat reproachfully
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_12;Dr. Gebhardt nearly killed you!
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_13;No one could have seen that coming. At least we managed to clear things up quickly.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_14;I would have preferred it if things went according to the old plan. We'd have swapped the jewel aboard the ship and Alex wouldn't have been kidnapped by Inch.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_15;And I'd have preferred it if you hadn't given me a nasty bump on my noggin!
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_16_direction;offended
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_16;And what would your excuse have been for staying on board if I hadn't? Hey, I improvised.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_17;Hmm. Good point.
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#26;[The young woman leans against Ohis shoulder. The Arab begins to open a champagne bottle and filles three glasses.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_18;I was afraid Inch would realize that you were wearing a bulletproof vest.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_19;"He was too confident. After he foiled your ""plan"", he thought he had everything under control."
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_20;He never really took a look at the emerald in the display case. He just assumed that they shipped the real jewel from Switzerland.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_21;And after my little tussle with Inch, we had both jewels.    
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_22;He blew half the museum to smithereens just to steal a fake.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_23;He was always rude and insolent. I never should have worked with him. His double-dealing cost his brother's life...
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_24;And his own as well.
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_25;I'd still rather see him in jail than in a morgue.
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#35;[The Arab gives the wife and Ohi one glass of champagn. They take it, the woman sits up straight.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_26;He shouldn't have messed with the Raven.
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#37;[The Arab takes his own glass in hand, they raise the glasses.]
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_27;To your retirement!
spokentexts_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist_st_28;To the future!
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#40;[They begin to empty their glasses.]
sequences_a23_duene_seq_a23_duene_twist#41;[Cut back. The three figures on the dune in front of the sea.]
